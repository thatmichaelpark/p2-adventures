This directory contains two demos:
- demo.spin2
- complexdemo.spin2

demo.spin2 demonstrates text display on a VGA or HDMI monitor. complexdemo.spin2 demonstrates text and graphics on a VGA or HDMI monitor.

Compile with FlexProp 6.5.0 (these programs do not compile with PropTool).

Hardware required:
- P2 Edge (with or without 32MB memory)
- P2 Edge Breadboard
- P2 Eval A/V Breakout Add-on Board (for VGA)
- P2 Eval Digital Video Out Add-on Board (for HDMI)

(or equivalents)

N.B. These demos use an old (obsolete?) version of Roger Loh's driver.
